# OneDrive Folder Content Loader
A practical but not efficient solution to fix the OneDrive problem of not loading the complete list of folders and their contents in macOS!

In macOS, large OneDrive folders with deep and complex folder structures fail to load. This problem prevents searching the contents of OneDrive folders and their contents without manually opening them first. This is a known issue due to the nature of the Files On-Demand feature, which only downloads placeholders until a file or folder is accessed. However, this has proven to be a significant inconvenience if you have a deeply nested folder structure since it is not feasible to manually open each folder to make the contents searchable.

This practical but not efficient workaround attempts to open folders to trigger the metadata download

Note that this is not an efficient solution due to the number of folders and the potential impact on system performance, but remediates this serious OneDrive problem since all OneDrive folders are no longer needed to be opened manually one by one first.
